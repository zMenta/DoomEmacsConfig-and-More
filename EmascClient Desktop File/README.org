* Creating an emacsclient desktop shortcut

- You can find the emacs desktop file path using this command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo find / -iname emacs.desktop
#+END_SRC

- Use the command cp to copy the path and create another .desktop file of emacs as emacsclient
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo cp /usr/share/applications/emacs.desktop /usr/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop
#+END_SRC

- Final step is to modify the file name and exec to emacsclient like in the .desktop file example.
